### Let's define a `"sevenish"` number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1, 7, 8, 49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the nth sevenish number.

## Input/Output
```
> sevenish_number(1)
  1
> sevenish_number(5)
  50
> sevenish_number(10)
  350
```
