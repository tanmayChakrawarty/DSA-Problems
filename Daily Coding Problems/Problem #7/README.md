## This problem was asked by Google.

### Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

### The following test should pass:
``` 
Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
Codec ser = new Codec();
Codec deser = new Codec();
TreeNode ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root));
```
