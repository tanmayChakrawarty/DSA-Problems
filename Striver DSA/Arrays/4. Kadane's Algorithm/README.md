# Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array

## Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum and print the subarray.

## Input/Output
```
Input: arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 

Output: 6 

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.  

Input: arr = [1] 

Output: 1 

Explanation: Array has only one element and which is giving positive sum of 1.
