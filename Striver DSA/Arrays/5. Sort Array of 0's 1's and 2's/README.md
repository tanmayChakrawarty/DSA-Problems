# Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's

## Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a program to in-place sort the array without using inbuilt sort functions. ( Expected: Single pass-O(N) and constant space)

## Input/Output
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Input: nums = [0]
Input: nums = [0]
